# June 2025 - Upper Peninsula, Michigan
Photos from my solo camping trip in June 2025 to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

It is recommended that you listen to the (obligatory) classic song ["Waterfalls" by TLC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R09S7CNPhFs&list=RDR09S7CNPhFs&start_radio=1) for the best viewing experience.

    Q: How did you take this?
    A: No, I would not talk to someone. Instead I balanced rocks against my phone and used the timer.

### Agate Falls
- Tree leaves covered the view of the large falls
- The site is a roadside park and has an under bridge walkway to get to the falls
    - The graphitti under the bridge included a great quote from the movie `The Princess Bride`
        - *Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die*
    - The graphitti also told me to call [*Jenny*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTdTwcmxyo) at `867-5309`, so basically I got a girl's number.
        - *"I saw your name and number on the wall"*

### O Kun de Kun Falls
- This trail includes both the `O Kun de Kun Falls` and the `Konteka Falls`
- There was a logbook located at the suspension bridge by `O Kun de Kun Falls` that was an interesting read.

### Konteka Falls
- The *Witch Tree or Spirit Tree* (where a tree roots grow out over rocks and open water) was prominent

### Presque Isle State Park

#### Lake Superior
- There was one suprsingly calm evening where the waters of `Lake Superior` were still. I took this opportunity to skip rocks as the rocky beaches are full of perfect skipping stones!
- The last photo in this section is a typical `41Â° F` beach day in June! Wind chill factor made the winter hat and coat mandatory.

![Lake Superior Temperature](personal_photos/LakeSuperiorTemperature.jpg)

#### Campsite
- The campsite butted up against `Lake Superior`. However, there was a hundred foot bluff that prevented easy lakefront access.
    - There was a wooden staircase that brought you down to the lake
- Hot meals were primarily cubed potatoes, diced onions, scrambled eggs, and seasonings (garlic salt, red pepper flakes, garlic powder, topped with parsley) fried in butter.

### Manido Falls

### Manabezho Falls
- The downriver falls (second photo) was taken from a suspension bridge over the river.
- The left hand side of the photo shows circular rock erosion where the water spins around in a whirpool fashion

### Lake of the Clouds
- `Lake of the Clouds` is the most popular destination in the Porcupine Mountains

### North Mirror Lake
- `North Mirror Lake` had two rental cabins with provided canoes accessible via backpacking.
- The lowlands between the mountains were swampy and had long boardwalks, with many `garter snakes` sunbathing on the planks.

### Summit Peak Observation Tower
- Probably a better view in the fall vs the spring! I stole from photos from online to show what that would look like.

![Summit Peak Lookout Tower Fall](professional_photos/SummitPeakLookoutTowerFall.jpg)

### Trappers Falls
- `Trappers Falls` is about a quarter of the way up the hike from the trailhead to `Government Peak`

![Trappers Falls](personal_photos/TrappersFalls.jpg)

### Government Peak
- Peak elevation is 1850 feet
- Not a great view from the top in summer. Tree coverage makes the sweeping lanscape views difficult to see through the thick leaves.
- Would be a cool backpacking site as there is a campsite on the peak

![Government Peak Sign](personal_photos/GovernmentPeakSign.jpg)

## Copper Harbor

### The Elusive Montreal Falls
- My white whale. Google maps reported the trailhead about 15 miles into a seasonal ATV road.
- I never did make it to the falls, but I gave the Corolla some off road experience.

![Upper Montreal Falls](professional_photos/UpperMontrealFalls.jpg)

## Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore

### Upper Overlook

### Miners Falls & Beach

### Chapel Falls

### Mosquito Falls

### North Gemini Lake (State Forest Campground)
- Bring your bugspray. The mosquito to human ratio at my campsite was roughly `1,000 mosquitoes : 1 Caleb`

### Log Slide Overlook

### Lake Superior Overlook

## Tahquamenon Falls State Park

### Upper Falls

### Lower Falls

### River Trail
- Park signs claimed this was a round trip 5 hour hike `(8 miles total for out and back)`. I took this as a challenge and completed the hike in just over 2.5 hours.
- Hey bear! I met the same number of bears on the hike from the Upper to the Lower falls as humans.
