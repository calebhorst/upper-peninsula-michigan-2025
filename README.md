# June 2025 - Upper Peninsula, Michigan
Photos from my solo camping trip in June 2025 to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

It is recommended that you listen to the (obligatory) classic song ["Waterfalls" by TLC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R09S7CNPhFs&list=RDR09S7CNPhFs&start_radio=1) for the best viewing experience.

    Q: How did you take this?
    A: No, I would not talk to someone. Instead I balanced rocks against my phone and used the timer.

### Bond Falls

### Agate Falls

### O Kun de Kun Falls

#### Konteka Falls

### Preque Isle State Park

#### Lake Superior

#### Campsite

#### Manido Falls

#### Manabezho Falls

### Lake of the Clous

### North Mirror Lake

### Summit Peak Lookout Tower

### Trappers Falls

### Government Peak
- Peak elevation is 1850 feet
- Not a great view from the top in summer. Tree coverage makes the sweeping lanscape views difficult to see through the thick leaves.
- Would be a cool backpacking site, as there is a camping setup on the peak

## Copper Harbor

### The Elusive Montreal Falls
- My white whale. Google maps reported the trailhead about 15 miles into a seasonal ATV road.
- I never did make it to the falls, but I gave the Corolla some off road experience.

## Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore

### Upper Overlook

### Miners Falls & Beach

### Chapel Falls

### Mosquito Falls

### North Gemini Lake (State Forest Campground)
- Bring your bugspray. The mosquito to human ratio at my campsite was roughly `1,000 mosquitoes : 1 Caleb`

### Log Slide Overlook

### Lake Superior Overlook

## Tahquamenon Falls State Park

### Upper Falls

### Lower Falls

### River Trail
- Park signs claimed this was a round trip 5 hour hike `(4 miles each way, total of 8 miles)`. I took this as a challenge and completed the hike in just over 2.5 hours.
- Hey bear! I met the same number of bears on the hike from the Upper to the Lower falls as humans.
